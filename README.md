# Diabetes Disease Progression

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on analyzing diabetes disease progression using various machine learning models. Below is a brief description of each notebook:

## Notebooks

### 1. **Fatimah Almusawi**


### 2. Fatimah Almusawi 
In this notbook we will Explore Multivariate Regression Using Polynomial, Decision Trees and kNN, to optimize a model for predicting diabetes disease progression.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset

The notebooks use the diabetes dataset, typically available in scikit-learn's datasets module. Ensure to load the dataset using appropriate functions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Almusawi110/diabetes-disease-progression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd diabetes-disease-progression
    ```
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
